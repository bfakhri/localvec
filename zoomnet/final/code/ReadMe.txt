This code/ directory houses all of the code necessary for training and testing ZoomNet
A description of all of the files is below:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
train_synthetic.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside Toolbox/Libary Dependencies: 
	Python version 2.7.12
	Keras version 2.0.2
Dependencies Written for the Project: 
	data_gen.py
	
This file trains a ZoomNet model using synthetic data generated by data_gen.py. The file
outputs the trained model as a json file storing the model params 'model_params.json' 
and an HDF5 file storing the weights of the trained model 'model_weights.h5'. Training
this model is not 100% stable; it may take several runs to train an optimal model.

test_synthetic_iterative.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside Toolbox/Libary Dependencies: 
	Python version 2.7.12
	Keras version 2.0.2
	Numpy version 1.12.1
	OpenCV version 3.2.0-dev
Dependencies Written for the Project: 
	data_gen.py
	calculate_IoU.py
	
This file tests a ZoomNet model using synthetic data generated by data_gen.py. The file
imports the trained model outputed by train_synthetic.py and runs it on a testing set 
of synthetic images generated by data_get.py. Note - these images are separate and 
unique from the images used to train the model. The script calculates the average IoU 
performance using methods in the calculate_IoU.py file. It outputs this performance
metric that is used to evaluate ZoomNet as a whole.

Generates synethic data by overlaying Pascal VOC 2012 images with synthetic "objects" 
and outputing arrays for training, training validation, and testing along with their
respective label arrays. A script to automatically download and extract the Pascal VOC 
data is located in ../data/

calculate_IoU.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outside Toolbox/Libary Dependencies: 
	Python version 2.7.12
	
Dependencies Written for the Project: 
	N/A
	
Defines a single function that calculates the Intersection over Union (IoU) and returns
this result. It is used by test_synthetic_iterative.py to assess the quality of the 
model being tested.
