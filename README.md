# ZoomNet 

ZoomNet is a deep object detection (localization) framework that works by iteratively zooming into an image. 
The network outputs a vector indicating how far we must zoom into the image (in all direction) in order to center the object of interest.

# Dependencies

* Python 2.7 or 3.5
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) 
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)

# Getting Started

## Install Necessary Dependencies
1) Install Keras
    - pip install keras

2) Install TensorFlow
    - Use this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

3) Install OpenCV
    - We used this tutorial: http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html

4) Install Missing Python Modules
    - pip install numpy

## Run our code
1) Download relevant data
    - Go to the data/ directory
    - Run the script get_data.sh
    - This will download the Pascal VOC2012 dataset necessary for trainint/testing
    - Estimated Runtime: 30 Minutes to 2Hrs depending on connection

2) Train the model (if you do not want to waste time training the model, use the
            get_trained_model.sh script to download a trained model.
    - Go to code/ directory
    - Run train_synthetic.py
    - This will train the model with the synthetic data generated by data_gen.py
    - Estimated Runtime: 25 Minutes on GTX 1080

3) Run and test the model using our iterative approach
    - Go to code/ directory
    - Run test_synthetic_iterative.py
    - This will test the model outputted in step 2
    - An average intersection over union score will be calculated
    - Estimated Runtime: 25 Minutes on GTX 1080

Note - Demonstration runs on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
